## Game Turn Overview

Play proceeds clockwise.  
On a player’s turn, they **must perform exactly one** of the following actions:

1. **Draw Train Car Cards**
2. **Claim a Route**
3. **Draw Destination Tickets**

---

### 1. Draw Train Car Cards

- Draw **2 cards** in total.
- Each draw can be:
    - From the **face-up** cards
    - Or the **top of the deck** (blind draw)
- Replace face-up cards immediately after drawing.

**Special Rule – Locomotive Cards:**
- Locomotives are multicolored wild cards.
- If a face-up Locomotive is taken, it counts as **both draws**.
- If 3 or more Locomotives appear face-up, discard all 5 cards and reveal 5 new ones.

---

### 2. Claim a Route

- To claim a route, play a set of Train Car cards **matching the route’s color and length**.
- Place your Train Cars on each space of that route.
- Score points immediately based on the **Route Scoring Table** (below).
- Discard used cards.
- A player can claim **only one route** per turn.

**Double Routes:**
- Some cities have two parallel routes.
- In 2–3 player games, **only one** of the two can be used.
- In 4–5 player games, both may be used — but not by the same player.

**Gray Routes:**  
May be claimed with any single color set.

---

### 3. Draw Destination Tickets

- Draw **3 new Destination Tickets**.
- Keep at least **1**, possibly **2 or all 3**.
- Return unwanted tickets to the bottom of the deck.
- Tickets remain secret until game end.

## Route Scoring Table

| Route Length | Points |
|---------------|---------|
| 1             | 1 |
| 2             | 2 |
| 3             | 4 |
| 4             | 7 |
| 5             | 10 |
| 6             | 15 |

---

## Destination Tickets

- Each shows two cities and a point value.
- Complete the route = **add** the points.
- Fail to connect = **subtract** the points.
- Tickets remain secret until final scoring.

---

## End of Game

When a player has **0, 1, or 2 trains left** at the end of their turn,  
each player (including them) gets **one final turn**.

---

## Final Scoring

1. Verify points from claimed routes.
2. Reveal and score Destination Tickets (add or subtract).
3. Award the **Longest Continuous Path** bonus (+10 points).
    - A continuous path can include loops and revisit cities but may not reuse a train car twice.
    - In a tie, all tied players receive the bonus.

**Winner:**  
The player with the **highest total score**.  
If tied, the player with the **most completed Destination Tickets** wins.  
If still tied, the player with the **Longest Path** wins.
